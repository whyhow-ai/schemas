# Cultural Heritage and Art Crime Domain Schema

## Background

Managing data in the complex field of cultural heritage and art crime requires a detailed and structured approach to track interactions between actors, organizations, and artifacts. This schema facilitates the organization of such data, enhancing the ability to investigate, document, and analyze interactions and transactions within this domain.

## Scenario

Imagine a scenario where law enforcement, researchers, or cultural heritage organizations need to analyze data involving the theft, sale, and possession of artefacts. This schema allows for a systematic approach to record and retrieve information about artefacts, their provenance, and the individuals and organizations involved in their lifecycle. This is particularly useful in cases involving legal proceedings, repatriation efforts, and academic research into art crime.
This schema can answer queries such as:

- Who owns a particular artifact?
- Which artifacts are involved in a legal dispute?
- What are the connections between dealers, looters, and auction houses?
